1.2.0 - ??? ?? ????

- Add 'pkgbuild-get-version' script. Will extract the version and release from a given PKGBUILD (if 1 arg), PKGBUILD in current directory (if no arg), or will print a list pkgname-pkgver-pkgrel if multiple PKGBUILDs are specified.

1.1.0 - Jul 14 2018

- extractMtree.py - Major updates to the "process a package" primary function.

 * Greatly simplify logic into a single call to self.doOne and a single set of Exception handlers, rather than 3 copies (one within the exception handler for the retry there and then one later on if that failed to retry on all repos). A failure on a given repo is still retried against all repos, but just in a much better and cleaner way.

 * Add a new exception RetryWithNextMirrorException which is raised when we get no data from an upstream server, or if the file we download is corrupted. It will retry the operation on the next mirror

 * Improve logging in the main method to better note what is going on

 * Improve handling of short vs long timeout

- extractMtree.py - Fixes and cleanups
 * Fix issue where division of packages amongst worker threads could fail in some cases.
 * Explicitly check the number of threads expected vs actual and try to recreate if something is not right (shouldn't happen anymore because of fix for the final 'overflow' thread, but at least future-proofed).
 * Add a check for when a mirror returns no data for a package, and fail it gracefully.
 * Add a few more logging messages


1.0.1 - Apr 17 2018

- extractMtree.py - Fix backwards order of versions in "old version detected" message

- extractMtree.py - Check and warn if we are using cmp_version < 3.0.0, which will sometimes provide invalid version comparisons, and update requirements.txt to explicitly require >= 3.0.0


1.0.0 - Feb 04 2018

- Expand the comments throughout data/makepkg.conf [extras]

- Many additional functions and cleanups in makepkg.conf


0.8.4 - Dec 06 2017

- Fix some permissions issues with abs2 command (and thus archsrc-*pkg and aur-*pkg commands)

- Export the profile name SAFE_LTO as advertised


0.8.3 - Nov 17 2017

- Add "findgcda" helper command (as of yet undocumented)

- Add -fprofile-update=prefer-atomic  to the profile generation
CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS ( for extas/makepkg.conf ) to better protect against possible
corruption of gcda files during multithreaded or similar conditions


0.8.2 - Aug 31 2017

- Fixup abs2 to work in some cases it was not before (and thus the
archsrc-getpkg etc commands)

0.8.0 - Jun 17 2017

- extras (makepkg.conf) - Remove "--as-needed" from LDFLAGS for all profiles,
it breaks several builds, especially in combination with LTO or profiling
- extras (makepkg.conf) - Add "nolto" option which can be passed to the
profile functions, ( e.x. set_cflags_do_profile 'nolto' ), which will enable
profiling WITHOUT enabling lto and linker plugin ( aka ld.gold )
- Unset "PACKAGER" field, which was set to me
