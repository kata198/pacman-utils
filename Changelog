- Add "findgcda" helper command (as of yet undocumented)

CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS ( for extas/makepkg.conf ) to better protect against possible
corruption of gcda files during multithreaded or similar conditions

0.8.0 - Jun 17 2017

- extras (makepkg.conf) - Remove "--as-needed" from LDFLAGS for all profiles,
it breaks several builds, especially in combination with LTO or profiling
- extras (makepkg.conf) - Add "nolto" option which can be passed to the
profile functions, ( e.x. set_cflags_do_profile 'nolto' ), which will enable
profiling WITHOUT enabling lto and linker plugin ( aka ld.gold )
- Unset "PACKAGER" field, which was set to me
